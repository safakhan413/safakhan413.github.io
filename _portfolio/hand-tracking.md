title: "Hand tracking to control robot movements"
## I used Computer Vision for gesture recognition and then used gestures to control a robot!

I wrote the code for gesture detection using Googleâ€™s MediaPipe framework in conjunction with OpenCV. My friend and I combined our codes to control the motion of a really cool robot that he designed. 
ðŸ¤–âœ¨

Funny enough he just showed me his robot that he had designed which could be controlled by a minimalistic web application. I was working on a personal project already building a hand gesture detection application and I suggested that may be we could use index finger to control the movements of the robot and voila, in less than two days we integrated our codes and made it work!

That is what happens when two passionate minds come together! There is so much potential for building more fantastic projects if people from different fields come together

## This project is related to Web Development and MVT
Architected a fully functional intelligent web application (For instance, if you pass a word with typo, the app will suggest the right word. E.g. Try 'Rainn' in the text box.) 
Deployed the application on Heroku and used PostgreSQL as a database. Colors can be changed with the settings icon shown on the top right corner of the main page.
